# Citrus Drink Suggestions

My Phase-1-Project is a simple app that gives citrus drink suggestions from a public drink API, TheCocktailDB. The app has three citrus option buttons that you can select in order to see a selection of drink cards as suggestions of what to make or order. 
If the user does not like any of the options presented they do have the option to key-word search drinks the user would prefer. 

## Instalation

Use this link in order to install a clone of the project onto your own machine from git hub : 
```bash
git@github.com:AaronE007/Phase-1-Citrus-Project.git
```
Once you have cloned the project change directories into the project and type index.html into the terminal. 
## Usage

Clicking on any of the ingredient buttons below will return the name and a jpeg of drinks that include those ingredients in their recipes: 

```bash
Lemon Drink Options
Lime Drink Options
Orange Drink Options
```
Clicking on another drink button will clear the list of drink options and return a new list matching the next button clicked. 

If the user does see drinks they find appetizing they can use the "Seach..." bar to enter key words for drinks they think they might like. After clicking on the search button, the app will return the name and image of drinks including the key words of their search.
